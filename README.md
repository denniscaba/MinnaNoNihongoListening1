# MinnaNoNihongoListening1

-Added dialogue for Lesson 1, Question 1-3
-Corrected some dialogue
-Removed 30-second video ads by Adcolony in favor of banner ads
-Removed some banner ads
-Add furigana in the play list
**Sorry guys. There are still ads. But you can download the PRO version instead with no ads and with scripts (with furigana) to all the questions from 1-25.

Minna no Nihongo conversation & listening exercises for lesson 1-25.

Features:
-Auto-Play all items
-Skip, rewind, fast-forward audio
-Very simple, clean design
-Dialogue/script for "Kaiwa" (Please download the PRO version to view the dialogue for "Mondai" as well)

I know a lot of people are having difficulty listening to the exercises. That's why I created the PRO version where you can "sort of" cheat to view the script to the dialogue. I have also included the furigana to difficult Kanjis to help beginners in reading.
